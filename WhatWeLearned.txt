"What we learned from doing this final project"

After completing this final project, I've learned a lot more about dealing with an API and working
with version control in a team with Github. One of the things I realized about APIs after having gone through
multiple to decide on the one we used for this project, is the lack of Python-specific sample code. Having gone
from this class's notes where Python is the assumed language, the API documentation only provides general
instructions since the API should be accessible through multiple languages. This led to a large chunk of time
dedicated to testing different options of pulling data from the API for use in this project. - Working in a team
also encouraged both of us to use version control with Github to more easily deal with updating code. Although we
were only able to use version control for the last week of the project, it made passing code from member to member
much simpler and less complicated than sending Python scripts file by file.
